    <p>
      Implicit bias refers to the attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions in
      an unconscious manner. These biases are formed based on our upbringing, environment, and culture. Although we
      may not be aware of these biases within ourselves, it is important to learn about them and acknowledge them so
      that we can work to create more inclusive and diverse spaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      To help people identify implicit biases, Harvard created Project Implicit. This project has a number of tests
      that check for various implicit biases. To take the test, head <a href="https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html" target="_blank">HERE</a>

    <h2>
      Sam's Experience
    </h2>
    <p>
      Doing the implicit bias tests was a very interesting experience for me. I grew up in Waukesha County, WI, which is
      a very homogenous community. Even though I have moved to various places in my adult life and spent a lot of time
      educating myself and working to undo certain biases I felt I grew up around, it was interesting to see that sometimes
      remnants of those things remain–even implicitly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think it is natural to have biases; we are all products of our upbringings and surroundings. Certain experiences
      shape our natural reactions to things in ways we do not consciously understand. I was not surprised to learn that
      I have biases with some things. Of course, hearing that is disheartening, but I think it matters more what efforts
      we make consciously and how we work to undo biases we have. These implicit bias tests, even though they can be
      uncomfortable, are so important because they help us recognize how we navigate the world and our knee-jerk reactions to things.
      I don’t think that defines us, but it is important to be aware of so that we can work against them in order to not
      ingrain them into the next generation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The layout of the tests was confusing, and somewhat jarring. You are not given the time to think which is so unnatural
      with how tests typically work. After getting used to the layout, I was able to let the test do its thing. These
      results were enlightening, and I highly recommend that everyone take the time to perform these tests.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Mike's Experience
    </h2>
    <p>
      I found the implicit bias test from Harvard very illuminating. If someone were to ask me if I were prejudiced
      against any race, gender, religion, age, body type and aesthetics, etc. I would say that I am absolutely not, however
      the results from the Harvard Implicit Bias test tell a different story. While the test was a bit confusing at first,
      and there were times I questioned the accuracy of such a test, for a lay person like myself, the methodology makes sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Spite of what I consciously believe around topics of the implicit bias test, the results clearly show that I did
      have biases. When we have time to think and examine our beliefs and feels we can act consciously on them, but the
      implicit	 bias test works in such a way that it relies on immediate reaction. What I saw was that if I am not careful
      to examine my own thoughts, they will almost certainly carry bias with them. This leads to a very high chance my actions
      will inadvertently harm others, even if a surface level review leads me to conclude that they will not. I also believe
      that this is further complicated by my own intersectional identity, much of which aligns with the groups in power.
      It was both interesting and affirming to see this play out in the work done by Emillio J. Castilla in
      <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/achieving-meritocracy-in-the-workplace/">Achieving Meritocracy in the Workplace</a>
      as well as <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.2189/asqu.2010.55.4.543">The Paradox of Meritocracy in Organizations</a>
      by Castilla and Stephen Bernard
    </p>
    <p>
      While it might not initially feel good to see that I have the potential to act in a way that doesn’t align with my
      conscious values, I ultimately find Harvard’s Implicit Bias test very empowering. We all have implicit biases, but
      that doesn’t make any of us bad. By recognizing that I do have implicit biases I can work to make sure my thoughts
      and actions do not further harms against those who are underrepresented, by both examining those thoughts myself and
      seeking out the perspectives of those whose identity differs from my own and the status quo. This is not a
      zero-sum game, and perfect must not be the enemy of good.
