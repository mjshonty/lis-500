This repository contains the work that I and Sam Richter did as part of UW-Madison's LIS 500: Code and Power. As part of that course we were tasked with building a website to communicate our understanding of intersectionality, and showcase tech heroes who are not frequently featured in the news. For the final project we worked with Google's Teachable Machine as a way of demystifying machine learning and exploring the successes and failures of the technology.

This course was described as "...an intersectional examination of the Internet. In this course you will interrogate the role of power relations, race, class, and gender as they shape our digital experiences. This course is an asynchronous course, but there are weekly deadlines which you must keep up with.  Please use the tabs above to navigate  through the course materials. In this course, you will analyze and critique structural mechanisms related to racial and gender disparities in the computing industries, gaining practical and theoretical understanding of the means by which women and people of color negotiate conditions of exclusion or marginalization within computing."
